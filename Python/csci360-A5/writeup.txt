Number of iterations:
    increase in iterations generally produce a lower mse between the predicted output and the actual output
Data and Architecture:
    there is no free lunch. configuration of layers and nodes per layer is typically randomized and tested to find the most optimal configuration for the specific dataset
Learning rate:
    smaller learning rates give more optimal weights for the model but it takes longer to train
    larger learning rates give less optimal weights for the model but it takes faster to train
